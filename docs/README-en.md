- The letter 'i' is converted to "imes";

- The letter 'a' is converted to "ai";

- The letter 'o' is converted to "ober";

- The letter 'u' is converted to "ufat".
  
  

#### Requisitos

- It should only work with lowercase letters;

- Accented letters or special characters should not be used;

- It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to its original version.
  For example:
  "cat" => "cait"
  "cait" => "cat";

- The page must have fields for entering the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options;

- The result must be displayed on the screen.
  
  

#### Extras

A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard - that is, it should have the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option from  apps menus.
